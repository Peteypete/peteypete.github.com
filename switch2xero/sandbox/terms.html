    The QuickBooks® to Xero conversion Beta program utilizes 3rd party
    technology to import Your QuickBooks® data in Xero through Xero’s
    import API.&nbsp; Specifically, after submitting Your Quickbooks
    file we will process the file through a 3rd party technology
    provider to create XML and CSV files and load that data into Xero on
    Your behalf.&nbsp; Once loaded, we will transfer the new Xero
    organization back to You via the Subscriber Email address specified
    above.<br>
    <br>
    IT IS AGREED, in consideration of the covenants contained herein, as
    follows:<br>
    <br>
    1. Xero will take all reasonable steps to provide your QuickBooks
    data within Xero, however some data may not be convertible.&nbsp;
    Due to this, you will need to compare the trial balance information
    in QuickBooks and in Xero and&nbsp; confirm the data that is
    converted into Xero is indeed what you expect.&nbsp; XERO PROVIDES
    NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF
    THE CONVERTED DATA IN THE XERO ORGANIZATION. <br>
    <br>
    2.&nbsp; Xero will maintain all data and Information provided by You

    <br>
    3.&nbsp; You warrant that You have the right to provide the
    QuickBooks data to Xero.&nbsp; The data provided hereunder remains
    Your property and no license or other rights in or to such
    Information, including rights under any trade secrets, copyrights or
    patents, is granted by You.&nbsp; Xero acknowledges that the data
    provided by You hereunder is provided "as is" and there is no
    representation or warranty from You as to the accuracy or
    completeness thereof.<br>
    <br>
